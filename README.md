# Python Fundamentals Megaproject

A comprehensive, sectioned repository to learn and review core Python fundamentals.  
Each section lives in its own folder with a dedicated `README.md`, minimal theory, runnable examples, and small exercises you can try immediately.

## How to use
1. Navigate to a section folder (e.g., `07-conditional-logic`).
2. Read the `README.md` for concise explanations and examples.
3. Run the example scripts:
   
   ```powershell
   python example.py
   ```
5. Attempt the exercises in `exercises/` and compare with `exercises/solutions/`.
6. Progress sequentially or jump to topics you need.
